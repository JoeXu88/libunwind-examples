libunwind examples
------------------

A few libunwind examples:

  * backtrace.cpp --- shows a demangled backtrace.
  * more to come ...

Build instructions
------------------

On OSX, you should be able to just build as is. On other systems, you need to
link with `-lunwind`. You also need `cxxabi.h`, part of libstdc++.

I've used `-O0` for the examples, because llvm is surprisingly good at doing
tail call elimination.

Interesting pointers
